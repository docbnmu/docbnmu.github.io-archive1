## University Deptt. of Chemistry
> Bhupendra Narayan Mandal University also called B. N. Mandal University and in short. BNMU is situated at the district headquarter, Madhepura a district in Bihar. It is known for adding glory to the educational atmosphere of this district and itâ€™s surrounding. It is a regional university famous for its quality teaching.



> The Department of Chemistry is one of those in few Departments, which were established soon after the inception of the B.N.M University in 1992. Over the period, the Department has been nurtured under the able guidance of the eminent educationist/chemists like Prof.Ram Badan Yadav, (former VC ,BNMU)  Prof.R K Choudhary(former VC ,BNMU), Prof.Q Ashan(former VC ,BNMU), Prof. B N Prasad,  to name a few. The present faculty members are actively engaged, beside their teaching programme, in pursuing research in frontier areas of chemistry. As a result, during the last decade nearly 75 students were awarded Ph.D degree and around 250 research papers were published from this Department in reputed National and International Journals. To keep a pace with the advancement in frontier areas of Chemistry, our faculty members have been visiting laboratories of renowned chemists of foreign country Nigeria and have collaborative projects with them.This has brought the Department to a level where we can venture to pursue research in frontier areas of chemistry. Research areas being pursued in the Department are mainly focused on the development of Coordination Chemistry, Enviromental Chemistry , Orgonometallic Compounds and Medicinal Chemistry .


> University Department of Chemistry is one of the earliest department  to be established  by  the  B.N. Mandal University  in  2000 vide letter of Government of Bihar vide its letter No. 15/G/1-08/98-210  Dated 31-01-2000 efforts are being made to enhance these facilities through internal recourses & with the help of UGC Grant.  Department of Chemistry, situated in the picturesque surroundings on the University Campus, offers programs leading to M. Sc., Pre. Ph.D and Ph.D. degrees.

  
  

> The University Department of Chemistry is performing it duties in teaching and research areas smoothly since then with its meager and limited infrastructures and human resources. After the recognition of this University in the year 2004 under section 12 (B) of the UGC Act. 1956 and simultaneous allocation of financial grants, the university started some major construction work of academic building for post graduate department.

  
  

> DOC is being equipped to conduct research in advanced areas, through highly qualified and experienced teachers.  The department has received several sophisticated instruments to do frontier research in a broad range of disciplines. These includes UV-VIS, spectrometers, analytical tools like HPLC, Water analyzer, PH meter distilled water instruments etc



> At P.G. level specialization is available on organic, inorganic, physical and analytical chemistry& Computer Science. Students have choice of one elective paper. A four semester M. Sc. course in chemistry is being to start from session 2013-14. After the establishment the DOC about 90 Candidates were awarded Ph.D Degree in different area like Organometallic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Physical Chemistry & Inorganic Chemistry. While 34 Research Scholar are engaged in research work in running stage.
